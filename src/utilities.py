    This is a modified copy from:
    https://github.com/WZBSocialScienceCenter/geovoronoi/blob/master/geovoronoi/_voronoi.py


    Generate Voronoi regions from NumPy array of 2D coordinates or list of Shapely Point objects in `coord`. These
    points must lie within a shape `geo_shape` which must be a valid Shapely Polygon or MultiPolygon object. If
    `geo_shape` is a MultiPolygon, each of its sub-geometries will be either treated separately during Voronoi
    region generation when `per_geom` is True or otherwise the whole MultiPolygon is treated as one object. In the
    former case, Voronoi regions may not span from one sub-geometry to another (e.g. from one island to another
    island) which also means that sub-geometries may remain empty (e.g. when there are no points on an island). In the
    latter case Voronoi regions from one sub-geometry may span to another sub-geometry, hence all sub-geometries
    should be covered by a Voronoi region as a result.
    This function returns at least two dicts in a tuple, called `region_polys` and `region_pts`. The first contains a
    dict that maps unique Voronoi region IDs to the generated Voronoi region geometries as Shapely Polygon/MultiPolygon
    objects. The second contains a dict that maps the region IDs to a list of point indices of `coords`. This dict
    describes which Voronoi region contains which points. By definition a Voronoi region surrounds only a single point.
    However, if you have duplicate coordinates in `coords`, these duplicate points will be surrounded by the same
    Voronoi region.
    The structure of the returned dicts depends on `results_per_geom`. If `results_per_geom` is False, there is a direct
    mapping from Voronoi region ID to region geometry or assigned points respectively. If `results_per_geom` is True,
    both dicts map a sub-geometry ID from `geo_shape` (the index of the sub-geometry in `geo_shape.geoms`) to the
    respective dict which in turn map a Voronoi region ID to its region geometry or assigned points.
    To conclude with N coordinates in `coords` and `results_per_geom` is False (default):
    ```
    region_polys =
    {
        0: <Shapely Polygon/MultiPolygon>,
        1: <Shapely Polygon/MultiPolygon>,
        ...
        N-1: <Shapely Polygon/MultiPolygon>
    }
    region_pts =
    {
        0: [5],
        1: [7, 2],   # coords[7] and coords[2] are duplicates
        ...
        N-1: [3]
    }
    ```
    And if `results_per_geom` is True and there are M sub-geometries in `geo_shape`:
    ```
    region_polys =
    {
        0: {   # first sub-geometry in `geom_shape` with Voronoi regions inside
            4: <Shapely Polygon/MultiPolygon>,
            2: <Shapely Polygon/MultiPolygon>,
            ...
        },
        ...
        M-1: { # last sub-geometry in `geom_shape` with Voronoi regions inside
            9: <Shapely Polygon/MultiPolygon>,
            12: <Shapely Polygon/MultiPolygon>,
            ...
        },
    }
    region_pts = (similar to above)
    ```
